These tests can be run both from file and from an Apache web server.

From file, simply put the files on your disk, keeping the directory
structure and load the index.html file in the browser to test.

There are some tests which rely on a mimetype http header to be
provided. Those tests will be skipped when run from file.

To run the tests from an Apache server, copy the files to a directory
that is available from your web server, keeping the directory structure
intact. This compliance test contains .htaccess file(s) configured
to provide certain mimetypes with the test files. This requires that
you have made overrides in the test directories using "AllowOverride
all".

If you are going to test a prefixed implementation of @viewport,
run the prefix.py script.
